#Great job! You’ve created two classes and defined their interactions. This is object-oriented programming! From here you could:

#-Write a Grade method .is_passing() that returns whether a Grade has a passing .score.
#-Write a Student method get_average() that returns the student’s average score.
#-Add an instance variable to Student that is a dictionary called .attendance, with dates as keys and booleans as values that indicate whether the student attended school that day.
#-Write your own classes to do whatever logic you want!
