#Create a function called append_size that has one parameter named lst.
#The function should append the size of lst (inclusive) to the end of lst. The function should then return this new list.
#For example, if lst was [23, 42, 108], the function should return [23, 42, 108, 3] because the size of lst was originally 3.

#Write your function here
def append_size(lst):
  lst.append(len(lst))
  return lst

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(append_size([23, 42, 108]))
